# Disclaimer

Before this story starts, I have to discuss a couple of details. To begin with, it doesn't target any specific person, group, or corporation. Furthermore, I don't try to influence any decision in the current pandemic context. It is structured in mini-chapters titled by the topic they cover. You are free to interpret it however you want.

# Introduction

You are an average person living a normal life, in a developed country. You have a stable job, in an office. You always listen to what your superiors say. You never questioned any decision taken by someone "more important" than you, because they only want what's the best for you, right? The year is 2023, it's autumn. This is just a day of your life, just like any other.
<LineBreak />
It's morning, you wake up, or do you? You eat your breakfast, the exact same one you eat daily, for years. Once you're ready, you go outside to get to work. You really don't want to be late.

# Feelings

You go to the nearby bus station. It's cold and it's raining. You take a look at your watch, it takes so long for the bus to come. You get frustrated. Someone tells you there's a bus strike. You turn even angrier, you have to walk on foot until work. You run through the rain, hoping you won't be late.
<LineBreak />
As you walk, you start thinking why you're upset. You imposed yourself you must get in time to work, but does anyone care? You don't want to risk. You told yourself you are in a bad situation. You think you aren't guilty of any of this, you can't control the busses or the weather, right? You are angry because you want to be angry, what if instead you want to be happy or sad? You don't know. Actually, you don't think any of this, you just walk stressed in silence.

# Work

You get to your workplace. As you enter the building, no one notices you. You go to your small office, where you spend all your days. You open the computer and you start working, just as usual. In the end, this is the job you "love the most" and this is how you want to spend the rest of your days, right? You think you are happy with this job, you are paid well. You are working here for many years, since you finished college. You don't want to change it, you're afraid if you resign you might not find a better one, or any at all. Why risk it?
<LineBreak />
After a couple of hours, you feel like it never ends. You've been doing the same stuff all over again. You get bored. No one seems to be around you. You take your phone and you start scrolling on social media. You are hypnotized by it. You can't stop scrolling. The content you view is composed either of really short videos or just images. They have to keep you entertained, they know very well you can't pay attention for long. They know a lot more about you.
<LineBreak />
As you scroll, you question why that platform is free to use, they have to somehow make a profit, right? You realize you are the product. Through all those entertaining posts, there are ads. Trackers are running in the background. You are being spied. All this information, collected from your camera, location, microphone, and screen, is later sold for a profit. You are being exploited by the big corporations for money, or are you? You don't question this, you scroll a bit more and then you go back to work.

# Obedience

You are done with work for today. You decide to take dinner at the mall. You wait in line at the entrance to get your green certificate verified. You are vaccinated, of course, you are. You are a rational person, if the government said to get vaccinated, you listened. You know this is "the only way to get back to the normal", or is it? What is "normal" referring to, anyway? But you want it, so you listened. Right in front of you a guy was caught with a forge a proof they're vaccinated? You don't understand. You know the leaders want the best for the citizens.

# Consumption

Entering the mall, you see a bunch of ads everywhere. You see a very tasty meal in a picture, you want it. Before buying it, the cashier offered you a very good deal with a discount. You take it. Somehow you ended up spending much more than you wanted. But in the end, this is your choice, right?
<LineBreak />
Later, when you get home, you decide to watch a movie from your favorite streaming service, which you pay monthly for. Everyone does this, who doesn't pay for a streaming service? You are disgusted by the thought of someone watching a movie from a torrent, pirated, unethical, illegal. Why would anyone do this? Why bother to use a torrent when you can just open your tv and click on the show you want to watch? Actually, you don't question any of this, you just watch the show. You don't spot any of the many product placements or ads. After some time, you get bored and stop the movie for today.

# Reality

You still have some time left for today, so you decide to play with your virtual reality headset. You put it on with the vr gloves. Suddenly, your brain is overwhelmed with information. Now you can be everywhere and everything. You choose to be in the middle of a green and beautiful field, on a sunny day. You think you're feeling great, some fresh air and some sunlight. You see it, you feel it, you hear it, so it must be real, right? How do you know it's not real? You know you put your headset on. But what if you didn't know you have it on? You look in a mirror, within the virtual reality, you see your avatar. That is you, or is it? Everything feels so convincing. After some time, you take the headset off. You lose all your abilities to teleport, transform and control whatever you want. Now you are a normal human being, again. You feel dizzy, your brain is trying to adapt to the real world. After a couple of minutes, you're fine.

# The end

This was a day of your life, probably you won't remember anything you did today. Everything was just a daily routine, a standard protocol you follow. Nothing has changed since yesterday. Nothing will change tomorrow. Before going to sleep, you take your daily dose of forgetfulness and ignorance. The cycle continues for the rest of your life. I hope you're happy with it, are you?
